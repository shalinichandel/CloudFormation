# Snyk Infrastructure as Code - CloudFormation

The Snyk Infrastructure as Code product can scan CloudFormation templates for configuration issues.

[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) files can be a mix of YAML or JSON formats.

## Demo

This repository contains a mix of valid configuration files, which contain a range of configuration issues.

You can see the results by running
`snyk iac test .`

A snippet of the output looks as follows
